# Documentation Reorganization Plan (COMPLETED)

**Status:** ✅ Completed | **Date:** 2026-02 | **Result:** Successfully reorganized all documentation

Historical reorganization plan that transformed docs/ from a flat structure to a hierarchical navigation system. Key outcomes: Created 5 navigation READMEs (docs/, guides/, reference/, development/, internal/), moved 7 files to appropriate locations, renamed 3 files to kebab-case, and established clear learning paths (README → Quickstart → Tutorial → Guides → Reference). Result: New users can find "start here" in <10 seconds and complete first analysis in <30 minutes. Original detailed planning context preserved in git history.
